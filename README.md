# CPSC495_Final_Lab

This Search and Rescue project utilizes robot-operator cooperation to effectively search a large area for a desired goal point.

The Operator gives over-arching goals such as where to search.

The Robot then autonomously navigates to that location and then searches the surrounding area and reports if the object is  found, or asks
for the next location to search.
